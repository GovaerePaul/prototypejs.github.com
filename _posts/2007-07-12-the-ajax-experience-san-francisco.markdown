title: "The Ajax Experience, San Francisco"
---

The Ajax Experience is a series of tech conferences initiated by [Ajaxian.com](http://ajaxian.com/) co-founders Dion Almaer and Ben Galbraith.  This year, they hold conferences in San Francisco from July 25 to July 27, and Boston from October 24 to October 26.



I'll be privileged to fly 12 hours for the [San Francisco edition](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/west/index.html), in order to speak at not just [one](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/west/html/frameworks.html#CPorteneuveIntro), or [two](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/west/html/frameworks.html#CPorteneuveAdvPrototype), but _[three](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/west/html/frameworks.html#CPorteneuveScriptaculous)_ sessions there, all tacked up on the first day (two on Prototype, one on script.aculo.us).

This is going to be a great conference, chock a-block with cool sessions that'll cover not only our beloved Prototype, but most of the competition and many not-just-tech aspects.

Also look forward to Ryan Johnson's *Prototype patterns* session.

You can see it all on the [schedule](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/west/html/eventsataglance.html).

If you happen to attend, be sure to hook up! I look forward to seeing you there.
