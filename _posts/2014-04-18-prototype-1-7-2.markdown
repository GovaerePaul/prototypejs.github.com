title: "Prototype 1.7.2"
digest: "Like clockwork — assuming you own a horrible clock — the newest bugfix release of Prototype is out."
---

Because it’s a bugfix release, there are no earth-shattering changes, but here are the main ones:

* We updated to the latest version of [Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com) for better performance and to fix a few issues we’ve seen in the wild.
* We fixed an issue in recent versions of IE where an internal capability check was inadvertently triggering a "This page uses Java" dialog.
* We fixed a number of small issues in DOM- and layout-related methods.

For further details, you can look at [all the commits since 1.7.1](https://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/compare/1.7.1...1.7.2).

Since we tagged 1.7.2 last week, we’ve landed a bunch of bug fixes that will go into the next bugfix release. Also, note that we've moved our issue tracker off of Lighthouse and [into GitHub](https://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/issues) — thanks to [Jason Westbrook](https://github.com/jwestbrook) for helping to move tickets over to the new system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed bug fixes and documentation rewrites, thereby making this release possible!
