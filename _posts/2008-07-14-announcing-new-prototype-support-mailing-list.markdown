title: "Announcing new Prototype support mailing list"
---

Subscribers to the Rails Spinoffs mailing list should switch to our new, better-named list: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/prototype-scriptaculous" title="Prototype &amp; script.aculo.us | Google Groups">Prototype & script.aculo.us</a>.

While these two venerable libraries are, in truth, spinoffs of the Rails project, we've come to realize it's far more user-friendly to have the libraries' names in the name of the mailing list. This should help guide users to the right spot and reduce the amount of support traffic on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/prototype-core" title="Prototype: Core | Google Groups">Prototype Core mailing list</a> — which is for discussion of Prototype's development process, not support.
  
Because list spam is a sad reality, your first post to the list will be held for moderation. Once it's approved, though, you'll be able to post with impunity.
