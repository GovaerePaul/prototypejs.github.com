We've squeezed a couple more bugs and decided to play safe by releasing yet another release candidate: [Prototype 1.5.1_rc4](http://prototypejs.org/assets/2007/4/28/prototype.js).


Thanks to Ryan Schuft, it comes with a nice, new and long awaited feature: you won't ever again have to close Internet Explorer's window between each test.

Here's the full [changelog](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/spinoffs/prototype/tags/rel_1-5-1_rc4/CHANGELOG?format=raw).
