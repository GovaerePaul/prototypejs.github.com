title: "Want your code \"pimped\"?"
---

<p>We decided it&#8217;s finally time to implement an idea we had long ago.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an avid reader of the blog of Wil Shipley, a man in the business of writing great apps for OS X. His running code improvment series, <a href="http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/2005/07/i-will-insult-your-code.html" title="Call Me Fishmeal.: I will insult your code!">Pimp My Code</a>, takes submissions from readers who think their code needs refactoring. Then Shipley refactors them, explaining the whys and hows along the way. The submissions are small (never more than 75-100 lines), but in rewriting them Shipley always happens upon specific, useful programming tips. I don&#8217;t know the first thing about Objective-C, but I find the series fascinating and instructive.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;re going to do something similar on this blog. Do you have a piece of JavaScript you want refactored? Does it use Prototype? Do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign up for a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account if you don&#8217;t have one. It&#8217;s free and quick.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://gist.github.com/" title="Gist &mdash; GitHub">Gist</a>, GitHub&#8217;s pastebin app, and paste the code you want us to refactor. Mark it as &#8220;private&#8221; if you like.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/inbox/new/savetheclocktower">Message me on GitHub</a> with the URL to your code snippet. If necessary, explain a bit about what the code does (or should do), but don&#8217;t write an epistle or anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ll share the submissions with the rest of the team and we&#8217;ll pick a few that we like. Then we&#8217;ll dedicate a post to each one, refactoring out loud along the way. We won&#8217;t be mean or snarky; this is not a <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/" title="The Daily WTF: Curious Perversions in Information Technology">DailyWTF</a>-style exercise.</p>

<p>To pre-empt the obvious rebuttal: we do not consider this to be an act of charity, or code manna from computer heaven, or a gift from the light-bearers to the huddled masses. Whether we actually &#8220;improve&#8221; your code is not for us to say. It will, however, illustrate our coding style.</p>

<p>If that sounds useful to you, then step up! Give us code and ask that it be pimped!</p>
