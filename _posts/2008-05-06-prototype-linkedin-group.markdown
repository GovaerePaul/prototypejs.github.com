title: "Prototype Linkedin Group"
---

The Prototype community now has its own group on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com).

It's a great opportunity to connect with other developers and designers who are using Prototype in their daily work, get to know them better, and put a face next to the names you see daily in the mailing lists or on IRC.

The group's been up for a little under 24hrs and I already discovered voices in our community I wasn't aware of (For instance, check out Jason Harwig's [slides on JavaScript security](http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/jharwig?entry=javascript_security_slides_from_no)).

Joining is as easy as following this link (Note: LinkedIn asks that members be manually approved, I'll try to process your joining requests as fast as possible):

Don't forget to add your blog or personal website to your profile, it's a lot more fun.

Looking forward to see you there.
