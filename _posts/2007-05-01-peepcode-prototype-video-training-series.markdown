title: "PeepCode: Prototype Video Training Series"
---

Looking to polish up your Prototype skills or start *really* learning Prototype?  Our friends over at [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com) have released part one of a two part series on [JavaScript with Prototype](http://peepcode.com/products/javascript-with-prototypejs).  

The first part of this series is over an hour long and should be able to get anyone up to speed on Prototype fairly quickly.  Even those familiar with Prototype can take some useful tips away from this video.  The best part is that it's only $9.00!
