In addition to [releasing Prototype 1.6.1](http://prototypejs.org/blog/2009/9/1/prototype-1-6-1-released), I'm pleased to announce that Andrew Dupont and Tobie Langel now officially head up the Prototype Core Team. They'll be in charge of maintaining Prototype, deciding what makes the cut for new releases, and handling day-to-day operations.

This change in responsibility will let me focus on some infrastructural projects we need for the next-generation version of Prototype. It'll also help us fix bugs faster and release new versions more frequently. And I'll remain on the Core Team, contributing code and offering input on API design.

Andrew and Tobie have proved themselves to be worthy keepers of the code, so I'm certain Prototype is in good hands. Congratulations, guys, and thanks for all your hard work!
