Joe Hewitt has released an update to Firebug that addresses a Zero Day vulnerability.  It's recommended that everyone upgrade if you've got Firebug installed.

You can read more about [the update on Joe's blog](http://www.getfirebug.com/blog/2007/04/04/security-update/).  

Thanks to Ray Bango for the heads up on this.
