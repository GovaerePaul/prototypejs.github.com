title: "A call to Prototype developers"
---

In the spirit of our [Who's Using Prototype](/real-world) section, we'd like to add a new section to this site featuring a sample of the best built-with-Prototype third-party libraries available out there.

As we want to make this useful for Prototype users, rewarding for library developers _and_ maintainable (seriously, how frustrating is it to read the description of a lib and find out that the link to it is broken), we'll keep the number of displayed libraries to a reasonable amount. So there will be some selection.

We're looking for libraries that:

* work seamlessly with Prototype 1.5,
* are cross-browser,
* are well-maintained,
* are beautifully crafted, 
* meet a real need, and 
* are distributed under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) (or similar).

juicy extras (really not required, just highly appreciated):

* documentation and
* [unit tests](http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/UnitTesting) (we _love_ those).

If you think that you meet these requirements, we'd love to hear about you! All you need to do is fill [this form](http://prototypejs.wufoo.com/forms/builtwithprototype-3rd-party-libs/).

We're really excited to see what you have cooking.

### docmania

Totally unrelated to the above, but too cool not to be mentioned:

* [Josh Clark](http://www.globalmoxie.com/) has crafted a _superb_ PDF version of the docs which is [available for your downloading pleasure](http://beta.bigmedium.com/projects/prototype-pdf/index.shtml),
* [Wolfgang Bartelme](http://www.bartelme.at/) has designed a [beautiful dashboard widget](http://www.bartelme.at/journal/archive/prototype_reference_widget/) that allows easy access to the Prototype API,
* and, last but not least, [Marius Feraru](http://www.altblue.com/)'s Firefox sidebar is also [available for download](http://gfx.neohub.com/prototype-js-sidebar/).

Keep it coming!
