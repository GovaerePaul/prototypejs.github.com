### What's new?

To learn about new features in version 1.7, refer to the [blog post about the 1.7 RC1 release](http://prototypejs.org/2010/4/5/prototype-1-7-rc1-sizzle-layout-dimensions-api-event-delegation-and-more).

As always, this release includes an assortment of bug fixes. Consult the CHANGELOG for further details, or [see the full diff between this release and RC3](http://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/compare/1.7_rc3...1.7).

### What's next?

As I said when we released RC3, I'm eager to resume work on [script.aculo.us 2.0](http://scripty2.com), which had its first beta release two months ago. But we've also got plenty planned for the next few versions of Prototype:

* __The next bugfix version__ (1.7.0.1) will feature a rewrite of the DOM code to be easier to read and faster at the same time. We'll be consulting the [TaskSpeed benchmarks](http://dante.dojotoolkit.org/taskspeed/) throughout to measure our progress toward speeding up common DOM tasks.
* __The next minor release__ (1.7.1) will feature better compatibility with ECMAScript5 for all the stuff we share: `Function#bind`, `Array#map`, and so on. We'll make sure these methods are up to spec so that we can implement them as proper [polyfills](http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/) when they don't exist in the browser &mdash; and use the native versions where they do exist.
* __The next major release__ (1.8) will feature an overhaul of the Ajax code. We'll add a bunch of new features: JSONP, timeouts, guaranteed firing of callbacks for non-guaranteed readyStates, and a lot more.

In addition, there are exciting things in the future for [Evidence](https://github.com/tobie/Evidence) (the eventual replacement for our unit testing library) and [Sprockets](http://getsprockets.org/) (our JavaScript concatenator and dependency manager).
