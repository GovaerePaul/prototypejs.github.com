title: "Prototype 1.7 RC2"
digest: "We've just tagged Release Candidate 2 of Prototype 1.7, with the intent of putting out a final 1.7 release very soon."
---

In addition to the usual bug fixes, RC2 includes a late addition: the `Element#purge` method, used to dispose of an element (remove its event handlers and storage keys) before removing it from the page.

In addition, `Element#update` now performs a similar cleanup process on content that will be replaced via `innerHTML`. Both these additions should help keep memory usage down, especially for apps that create and destroy lots of DOM nodes.

Consult the [CHANGELOG](http://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/blob/1.7_rc2/CHANGELOG) for further details.
