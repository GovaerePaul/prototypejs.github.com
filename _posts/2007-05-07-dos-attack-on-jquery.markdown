title: "DOS attack on jQuery"
---

The web is a place full of surprises. And sometimes they aren't good ones. 


Most of you know [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/)'s excellent JavaScript library, well... the website it's hosted on has been the subject of DOS attack over the week-end, and its host kindly invited John to go look for hosting elsewhere.

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) has now found a new host, (you might still encounter issues connecting to it while the DNS propagates), but the move was costly and [Learning jQuery](http://www.learningjquery.com) is still [collecting funds to cover the move](http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/05/jquerycom-back-up). 

Please consider chipping in a dime or two.
